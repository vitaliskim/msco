Description: Co-occurrence patterns are typically explored between species pairs. However, doing
 so inevitably ignore the possible higher-order interference and interactions among three or more
 species in a community. To address this, the multi-species co-occurrence (msco; joint occupancy)
 index, which calculates the number of sites jointly occupied by multiple species simultaneously,
 was recently proposed. By reckoning with possible higher-order species interactions, joint
 occupancy index can encapsulate nine possible archetypes of species co-occurrence patterns and
 avert the statistical type II error by detecting patterns that would otherwise not be detected
 by any pairwise co-occurrence metrics. To dissect the effects of neutral encounter versus
 functional traits on multi-order species interactions and co-occurrence, generalised B-spline
 model has also been proposed. The R package ``msco'' presents the implementation of joint
 occupancy index and includes a list of functions for calculating this index for different
 orders, as well as testing and visualising species co-occurrence archetypes. This package also
 presents the implementation of the generalised B-spline model and analyses of the effects of
 neutral encounter versus functional traits on multi-order species interactions and co-occurrence.
