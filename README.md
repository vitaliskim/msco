# msco
An R package for multi-species co-occurrence analyses.

Caveat: This package (msco) has only been tested on Linux and Windows Operating Systems (OS). Its
functionality will soon be tested on Mac OS, after which it will be permanently archived in CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).
As such, we highly recommend using Linux or Windows OS in msco's current usage.
